# Quafu

Python toolkit for submitting quantum circuits on the superconducting quantum computing cloud [Quafu](http://120.46.160.173/). 


## Introduction

Quafu is developed for the users of [Quafu](http://120.46.160.173/) to construct, compile and execute quantum circuits on real quantum devices. One can use quafu to interact with different quantum backends provides by the experimental group of [Quafu](http://120.46.160.173/). 

## Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ScQ-Cloud/quafu
cd quafu
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

```
## Authors
This project is developed by the quantum cloud computing team at the Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Sciences.
