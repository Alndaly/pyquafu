# PyQuafu

Python toolkit for submitting quantum circuits on the superconducting quantum computing cloud [Quafu](http://quafu.baqis.ac.cn/). 


## Introduction

PyQuafu is developed for the users of [Quafu](http://quafu.baqis.ac.cn/) to construct, compile and execute quantum circuits on real quantum devices. One can use PyQuafu to interact with different quantum backends provides by the experimental group of [Quafu](http://quafu.baqis.ac.cn/). 

## Installation

```
pip install pyquafu 
```

## Document
Please see the website [docs](https://scq-cloud.github.io/).



## Examples

### 1.quantum_rl

The example shows quantum reinforcement learning interacts with Quafu to solve CartPole environment.
